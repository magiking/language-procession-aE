* What do we need to make?
  - similarity computation
    - need some kind of vectors to make that happen
  - design and implement some features? Does this mean feature vectors?
  - experiment
    - cosine similarity to calculate (pg. 158 in irbook)
    - word unigrams (term frequency)
    - tf-idf
    - add stemming/length normalization/stoplist
  
* irStub.py
  Example of creating feature vectors and computing similarity with them.
